# Where MNK

I'll preface by saying that I've been playing this game since late ARR, and this plugin was in the works since before Shadowbringers dropped.
I have a lot of experience playing this game, and I love it. It seems very few of you have read
[my manifesto](https://github.com/attickdoor/XIVComboPlugin/blob/master/statement.md),
so the nuance of "I want to protect the game's integrity while also encouraging the fat to be trimmed" flies right over most people's heads.

If you're asking for MNK combos, there are a few possibilities here:

1. You think XIVCombo is a "make the game easier" plugin and don't understand why I don't implement any feature that does that.
2. You haven't read [the manifesto](https://github.com/attickdoor/XIVComboPlugin/blob/master/statement.md),
and while you would agree with it, you simply don't know what you don't know.
3. You DO agree with [the manifesto](https://github.com/attickdoor/XIVComboPlugin/blob/master/statement.md),
but haven't put in the brain power to understand why MNK wouldn't work while following that philosophy.

## Words words words. Why no MNK???

**Because Perfect Balance exists. Also, because things like downtime and mistakes exist.**
The core issue with trying to get MNK into XIVCombo is that there are a lot of small decisions to be made.
Generally, the decision is the same every time, like how many rotations you do before refreshing Twin Snakes,
or the Dragon Kick > Bootshine alternation.

But PB throws a wrench in the whole works. Tell me, what GCDs should you guaranteed use, every single time, when PB is active?
Can you do that? I can't. You know who probably could?
Whichever "I'm better than you" Balance guide writer is currently overseeing the collective conscious for this job.
Not only do I actively, aggressively, not care what they have to say, the issue with using that information is that
*it's intelligent decision-making*. I don't know if you've noticed (you would if you've read
[my manifesto](https://github.com/attickdoor/XIVComboPlugin/blob/master/statement.md)),
but XIVCombo very explicitly **avoids** intelligent decision-making.

There's no clear-cut process on how to handle PB, nor is there a straightforward algorithm for recovering your
buffs, rotation, whatever, if there's a middling amount of downtime. What happens when you use Form Shift?
Should Twin Snakes show up? Maybe only if your buff timer is less than 8 seconds? That sounds awfully intelligent to me.
What about Demolish re-application? What if you know the boss is going away for downtime soon?
You can hopefully see how this goes on and on and on.

Worth noting for those of you who still haven't gone and read
[my manifesto](https://github.com/attickdoor/XIVComboPlugin/blob/master/statement.md):
This is why DNC and RDM aren't as developed as they could possibly be.
There are too many considerations that muddy the waters, and the intelligence required to surpass that is over the line.
A very easy example is RDM's long-casts. You always want to pre-cast a longcast at the start of any real fight.
So no solution can make Verthunder and Veraero inacessible without Dualcast. Chew on that one for a little bit.

## Deal with it

MNK isn't getting combos. You've been asking for them nonstop basically since XIVCombo's inception.
At one point I turned off feedback because none of you are sending any carefully considered suggestions,
only thoughtless whims that cross your mind.
You may want to give [this issue (not a link to](https://github.com/attickdoor/XIVComboPlugin/issues/119)
[my manifesto](https://github.com/attickdoor/XIVComboPlugin/blob/master/statement.md)[, I promise)](https://github.com/attickdoor/XIVComboPlugin/issues/119)
a read before making a suggestion.

Thanks. Stop for a moment and think before you open your mouth. Or use your fingers, whatever.
